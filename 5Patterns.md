## 5 Patterns

Explain in your own words with code examples in Elm and Haskell:

We can use pattern matching to split a data structure up

* How to use pattern matching to destruct various data structures as:

  * –lists

  * –tuples

    A tuple can be descructured as early as in the parameters of a function

  * –records

    Records can be descructured the same way

  * –union types
