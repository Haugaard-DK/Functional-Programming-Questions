## 2  Duality of programming

Explain in your own words with code examples in Elm and Haskell:

* The principle of currying

   ​	Currying is the technique of converting a function that takes multiple arguments into a sequence of functions that each take a single argument

* How to implement and use currying in Elm and Haskell

  * Elm

    * Define a function with n arguments

    * Define another function in terms of the first function being partially applied, that is, having only one argument passed to it

    * Call the second function and pass it the remaining arguments that the first function was expecting

      

  * Haskell

    * Pretty much the same as elm

* Typical currying use cases

  Code examples in other languages are encouraged as a supplement.
