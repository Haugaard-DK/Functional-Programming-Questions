## 4  Union Types

Explain in your own words with code examples in Elm and Haskell:

* How to handle polymorphism using union types

* How to handle errors using union types

  

  Elm and Haskell have different syntax for union types:

  type Maybe a

  ​	= Just a

  ​	| Nothing

  data Maybe a

  ​	= Nothing| 

  ​	Just a
